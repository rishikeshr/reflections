 This showed me the exact differences between the two files by filtering out the noise.
 Having easy access to the entire history of the file allows me to monitor the changes I am making and possibly revert back and forth easily.
 Git primarily helps with Code repositories and therefore helps to track dependencies across multiple files by allowing commits with multiple files.
 This will allow me to easily revert back to the exact version which introduced the bug as well as track which other components may have been affected.
 Create new code with impunity.
